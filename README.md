# Random-Task-Distribution
This is HTML, CSS, Javascript utility to randomnly divide some tasks between few teams. I have added one complexity layer if you want to have multiple categories of tasks (e.g. one Major category and other Minor category), and want one from each category to be assigned randomnly to a team.
